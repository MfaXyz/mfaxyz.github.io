Iâ€™m an engineer with over 4 years of experience developing immersive solutions using C#, Unity, and C++. I approach design not just by how it looks, but by how it works. I thrive on pushing the boundaries of innovation and enjoy collaborating on projects that require both technical and creative problem-solving.
